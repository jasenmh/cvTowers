I'm just getting familiar with OpenCV and Python.  This repo has some sample programs I'm working on to get the hang of things.

Right now, I can identify a ring of a specific color.  It is a manua process to
tune the filter.  Following is my plan in roughly the order I hope to 
accomplish it.

* Track identified ring
* Create class that encapsulates ring tracking filter
* Roll these together into an applications that tracks multiple color rings
* Start working on game logic
